## Happy Hour Party

{{< vimeo 124862139 >}}

## Happy Hour Tips
### In a Bar or Restaurant:
+ **Contact Restaurant in advance**
  + Reserve table for 8-10 people.
  + Ask to be placed off to the side.
  + Ask if willing to offer a special cocktail for the group - tie it to a fragrance.
+ **Pre-arrange with the Host to split the cost of an appetizer sampler**
  + This is an inexpensive way to reward the Host.
  + Often she will purchase appetizers for friends as it's less expensive than snacks at home.

### At Home:
+ Bring the Host an affordable bottle of wine as her Host gift.

### Remember:
+ Be in and out in one hour.
+ Keep your display and presentation simple.
+ Customize for year round success.
+ Look for gatherings that you can tack your Happy Hour Party onto like bowling nights, bingo, and other groups or clubs.
+ Most importantly, _**Have Fun!**_
