+ ~~Canada - product training/Spring summer catalog download link works, but not embed~~
+ ~~US - Host coaching for parties/host coaching checklist button doesnt work~~
+ partylite preferred info page text links broken
+ CA - your consultant website, videos are located on US server but not CA so links are broken (but thumbnails work)

  + CA - booking-call
  + US - get-paid, booking-call
